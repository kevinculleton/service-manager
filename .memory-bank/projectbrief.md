- Real-time service monitoring and status updates
- Secure, role-based access control

## Technical Goals
- Create a lightweight Flask-based web server
- Implement comprehensive systemd service management
- Provide professional UI/UX with modern design patterns
- Ensure secure service operations with proper permissions
- Support multiple services with configurable access levels
- Enable automated deployment and management

## Success Criteria
- Users can manage multiple services through an intuitive interface
- Professional-grade visual design and user experience
- Reliable service management functionality
- Automated deployment system with rollback capabilities
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Real-time status monitoring and updates

## Current Status
