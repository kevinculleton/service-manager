# Service Manager - Professional Service Management Platform - Project Intelligence

## Project Overview
Professional-grade web-based service management platform for systemd services with modern UI, granular permissions, and automated deployment. Originally started as a simple restart button, now evolved into a comprehensive service management solution.

## Key Patterns

### **Architecture Patterns**
- **Multi-Service Support**: Architecture supporting unlimited services with configurable permissions
- **Permission-Based Access**: Granular control over service operations (start/stop/restart)
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Auto-refresh status updates every 30 seconds
- **Professional UI**: Modern, responsive design system with enterprise-grade appearance

### **Technical Patterns**
- **Flask Backend**: Python 3.13 with Flask 2.3.3 for RESTful API
- **Modern Frontend**: CSS variables, Grid, Flexbox, and responsive design
- **Systemd Integration**: Direct systemd service management via subprocess
- **SSH-Based Deployment**: Automated deployment with rollback capabilities

### **Security Patterns**
- **SSH Key Authentication**: Passwordless, secure server access
- **Sudo Permission Management**: Limited, specific command permissions
- **Service-Level Permissions**: Configurable access levels per service
- **Status Check Permissions**: Separate control for read-only operations

## Technical Preferences

### **Backend Technology**
- **Python 3.13+**: Modern Python with async/await support
- **Flask 2.3.3**: Lightweight, extensible web framework
- **PyYAML 6.0.1**: YAML configuration management
- **Subprocess Integration**: Direct systemd command execution

### **Frontend Technology**
- **Modern CSS**: CSS variables, Grid, Flexbox, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ class-based architecture, no framework dependencies
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Professional iconography
- **Inter Font**: Modern, readable typography

### **System Integration**
- **Direct Systemd**: No abstraction layers, direct systemd integration
- **Sudo Permissions**: Custom permission scripts for secure operations
- **Service Discovery**: Automated service detection and configuration
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and status verification

## Development Approach

### **Platform Evolution**
- **Start Simple**: Begin with core service management functionality
- **Iterate Rapidly**: Add features based on real-world usage
- **Professional Polish**: Evolve from simple tool to enterprise platform
- **User Experience First**: Focus on intuitive, professional interface

### **Quality Standards**
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all service operations and error conditions
